        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <p>I am actively involved in bands as a guitarist and enjoy playing a wide variety of music from rock and mainstream to country and folk. I have a broad interest in art and I love travelling to experience new places and cultures. I engage in a range of creative writing projects and enjoy keeping fit at the gym as well as hiking and running. Currently, I am learning CAD, HTML, CSS and Javascript to gain skills in web development and 3D design.</p>
