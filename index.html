        <p>As an enthusiastic, committed and highly experienced educator and graduate of the Teach First Leadership Development Programme, I am a proven leader, able to engage and inspire outstanding progress and exceed expectations through reflective cooperation with colleagues. Successfully leading teams and designing subject provision has enabled me to develop transferable skills in management, comprehensive analysis and effective organisation within a high-pressure, results-oriented environment. I have a strong and proven sense of commitment and relish new challenges and opportunities. I greatly value the establishment of close and effective working relationships with colleagues to achieve a shared, ambitious vision.</p>
